Rain or Shine
By Camille Benson


Challenge problem given to me by HomeSpotter for intern candidates. 


WEATHER APP: Rain or Shine-Overview-
“We thank you for your interest in becoming a spring/summer intern for HomeSpotter’s engineering team. The engineering team at HomeSpotter is a fast-paced and dynamic environment that is supportive of your growth as an engineer. Interns at HomeSpotter are full-on members of the engineering team and work on real code and projects that will have lasting impact on our customers. If selected you will not be fetching coffee, lunch, or be at the beck and call of senior engineers; rather you will be working and learning from engineers that are the top of the field in their respective areas. One summer at HomeSpotter and you will experience the full spectrum of our engineering process and work/learn with the best.Because we’ve had a high level of interest for our limited intern positions, we are asking candidates to take one additional step; a pre qualification exercise. To be considered for the role we’d like you to construct a mobile application for either iOS (iPhone only) or Android devices that demonstrates the ability to analyze basic requirements, shows your development aptitude, demonstrates learning and integrating with external data. The basic requirements of this project should take between 10 and 12 hours to complete, the results of which will be discussed during the on-site interview stage should your project be selected.If this is interesting to you, take a shot! Show us what you’ve got!”
